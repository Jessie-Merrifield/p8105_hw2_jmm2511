## Question 1

Using datasets: pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv, and snp.csv.

*Goal*: merge these into a single data frame using year and month as
keys across datasets.

1.  Clean dataset pols_month

Use separate() to break up the variable mon into integer variables year,
month, and day; replace month number with month name; create a president
variable taking values gop and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop;
and remove the day variable.

``` r
#pols_month <- read_csv(file #="C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
 # separate(mon, into=c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  #mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)])%>% 
  #mutate(president=ifelse(prez_dem>0,"dem", "gop")) %>% 
  #select(-day, -prez_dem, -prez_gop)

#print(class(pols_month$month))

month_df = 
  tibble(
    month_num = 1:12,
    month_abb = month.abb,
    month = month.name
  )

pols_month = 
  read_csv("C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") |>
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    president = recode(prez_gop, "0" = "dem", "1" = "gop", "2" = "gop")) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, everything(), -day, -starts_with("prez")) 
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(month_num)`

2.  Clean dataset snp

clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above. For
consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month, and
organize so that year and month are the leading columns

``` r
#snp <- read_csv(file ="C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv")|>
 # separate(date, into=c("month", "day", "year"), convert = TRUE) |>
  #relocate(year, .before=month)|>
  #mutate(
   # year = if_else(year > 2023, year - 100, year))|> 
  #select(year, month, close) 

snp = 
  read_csv(
    "C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv",
    col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"))) |>
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    year = if_else(year > 2023, year - 100, year)) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, close) 
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(month_num)`

3.  Clean dataset unemployment

tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the previous
datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to “long”
format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and ensuring
that key variables take the same values

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month_num = 1:12,
    month_abb = month.abb,
    month = month.name
  )

unemployment = 
  read_csv("C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") |>
  rename(year = Year) |>
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month_abb",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, unemployment)
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(month_abb)`

Finally, merge the datasets

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result

- Explain briefly what each dataset contained

- describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the dimension, range of
  years, and names of key variables).

Notice that there are some `NA` values in the `close` and `unemployment`
variables, which indicate that the value of these variables is missing
at those locations.

## Question 2

Read and clean Mr. Trash Wheel dataset

- specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows
  with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in
  read_excel
- use reasonable variable names
- omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data

Update the data to include a new homes_powered variable based on this
calculation

``` r
mr_trashwheel<-
  read_excel("C:/Users/jmoon/Downloads/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data (1).xlsx",
             sheet="Mr. Trash Wheel",
             range = "A2:N586") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered=(weight_tons*(500/30))) %>%
  mutate(source="mr") %>% 
  mutate(year=as.numeric(year))

#584 observations of 15 variables
```

Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Professor Trash Wheel

``` r
prof_trashwheel<-
  read_excel("C:/Users/jmoon/Downloads/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data (1).xlsx",
             sheet="Professor Trash Wheel",
             range = "A2:M108") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered=(weight_tons*(500/30)))%>% 
  mutate(source="prof")

#106 observations of 14 variables

#216.26 tons total of trash collected
```

Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Gwynnda,

``` r
g_trashwheel<-
  read_excel("C:/Users/jmoon/Downloads/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data (1).xlsx",
             sheet="Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
             range = "A2:L157") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered=(weight_tons*(500/30)))%>% 
  mutate(source="gwynnda")

#155 observations of 13 variables

filter(g_trashwheel,year==2021, month=="July")
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 13
    ##   dumpster month  year date                weight_tons volume_cubic_yards
    ##      <dbl> <chr> <dbl> <dttm>                    <dbl>              <dbl>

    ## 2        2 July   2021 2021-07-07 00:00:00        2.26                 15
    ## 3        3 July   2021 2021-07-07 00:00:00        1.62                 15
    ## 4        4 July   2021 2021-07-16 00:00:00        1.76                 15
    ## 5        5 July   2021 2021-07-30 00:00:00        1.53                 15
    ## # ℹ 7 more variables: plastic_bottles <dbl>, polystyrene <dbl>,
    ## #   cigarette_butts <dbl>, plastic_bags <dbl>, wrappers <dbl>,
    ## #   homes_powered <dbl>, source <chr>

``` r
#16,3000 cigarette butts from July 2021
```

combine these with the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy
dataset. To keep track of which Trash Wheel is which, you may need to
add an additional variable to all datasets before combining.

``` r
trashwheel_tidy = 
  bind_rows(mr_trashwheel, prof_trashwheel, g_trashwheel) %>% 
  relocate(source) %>% 
  separate(date, into=c("year1", "month1", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  select(-year1,-month1) %>% 
  relocate(day, .before=year)

#I chose to separate out the day because the date value felt redundant

#there are 845 observations with 15 variables
```

*Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline
R.*

- note the number of observations in the resulting datasets

- give examples of key variables.

- what was the total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel?

- What was the total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in
  July of 2021?

## Question 3

Import, clean, and tidy the dataset of baseline demographics.

- Ensure that sex and APOE4 carrier status are appropriate encoded
  (i.e. not numeric)

- remove any participants who do not meet the stated inclusion criteria
  (i.e. no MCI at baseline).

- Discuss important steps in the import process and relevant features of
  the dataset.

``` r
baseline<-
  read.csv("C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv",
           skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(age_at_onset !=".")


print(class(baseline$sex))
```

    ## [1] "integer"

``` r
print(class(baseline$apoe4))
```

    ## [1] "integer"

*How many participants were recruited, and of these how many develop
MCI?*

*What is the average baseline age?*

*What proportion of women in the study are APOE4 carriers?)*

import, clean, and tidy the dataset of longitudinally observed biomarker
values;

*comment on the steps on the import process and the features of the
dataset.*

``` r
biomarkers<-read.csv("C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv",
                     skip=1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

*Check whether some participants appear in only the baseline or amyloid
datasets, and comment on your findings.*

Combine the demographic and biomarker datasets so that only participants
who appear in both datasets are retained

*briefly describe the resulting dataset;*

export the result as a CSV to your data directory.
