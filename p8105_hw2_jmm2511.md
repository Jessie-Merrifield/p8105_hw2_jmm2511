## Question 1

Using datasets: pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv, and snp.csv.

*Goal* merge these into a single data frame using year and month as keys
across datasets.

``` r
pols_month <- read_csv(file ="C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv")

unemployment <- read_csv(file ="C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv")

snp <- read_csv(file ="C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv")
```

1.  Clean dataset pols_month

Use separate() to break up the variable mon into integer variables year,
month, and day; replace month number with month name; create a president
variable taking values gop and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop;
and remove the day variable.

2.  Clean dataset snp

clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above. For
consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month, and
organize so that year and month are the leading columns

3.  Clean dataset unemployment

tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the previous
datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to “long”
format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and ensuring
that key variables take the same values

Finally, merge the datasets

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result

Short paragraph about the datasets in Q1:

Explain briefly what each dataset contained, and describe the resulting
dataset (e.g. give the dimension, range of years, and names of key
variables).
