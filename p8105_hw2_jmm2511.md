## Question 1

Using datasets: pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv, and snp.csv.

*Goal*: merge these into a single data frame using year and month as
keys across datasets.

1.  Clean dataset pols_month

Use separate() to break up the variable mon into integer variables year,
month, and day; replace month number with month name; create a president
variable taking values gop and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop;
and remove the day variable.

``` r
#alternate attempt
#pols_month <- read_csv(file #="C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
 # separate(mon, into=c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  #mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)])%>% 
  #mutate(president=ifelse(prez_dem>0,"dem", "gop")) %>% 
  #select(-day, -prez_dem, -prez_gop)

#print(class(pols_month$month))

month_df = 
  tibble(
    month_num = 1:12,
    month_abb = month.abb,
    month = month.name
  )

pols_month = 
  read_csv("C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") |>
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    president = recode(prez_gop, "0" = "dem", "1" = "gop", "2" = "gop")) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, everything(), -day, -starts_with("prez")) 
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(month_num)`

2.  Clean dataset snp

clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above. For
consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month, and
organize so that year and month are the leading columns

``` r
#alternate attempt
#snp <- read_csv(file ="C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv")|>
 # separate(date, into=c("month", "day", "year"), convert = TRUE) |>
  #relocate(year, .before=month)|>
  #mutate(
   # year = if_else(year > 2023, year - 100, year))|> 
  #select(year, month, close) 

snp = 
  read_csv(
    "C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv",
    col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"))) |>
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    year = if_else(year > 2023, year - 100, year)) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, close) 
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(month_num)`

3.  Clean dataset unemployment

tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the previous
datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to “long”
format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and ensuring
that key variables take the same values

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month_num = 1:12,
    month_abb = month.abb,
    month = month.name
  )

unemployment = 
  read_csv("C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") |>
  rename(year = Year) |>
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month_abb",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, unemployment)
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(month_abb)`

Finally, merge the datasets

``` r
data_538 = 
  left_join(pols_month, snp) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = unemployment)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`

``` r
str(data_538)
```

    ## tibble [822 × 13] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ year        : num [1:822] 1947 1947 1947 1947 1947 ...
    ##  $ month       : chr [1:822] "January" "February" "March" "April" ...

    ##  $ month_abb   : chr [1:822] "Jan" "Feb" "Mar" "Apr" ...
    ##  $ close       : num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
    ##  $ unemployment: num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...

The dataset pols_month contains 822 observations of 9 variables. It
describes the number of politicians who are democratic or republican at
that time.

The snp dataset contains 787 observations of 2 variables and describes
the Standard & Poor’s stock market index using the variable “close.”

The dataset unemployment contains 68 observations of 13 variables and
describes the yearly and monthly unemployment percentage.

There are 822 observations of 13 variables in the final dataset. The
years ranges from 1947 to 2015.

## Question 2

Read and clean Mr. Trash Wheel dataset

``` r
mr_trashwheel<-
  read_excel("C:/Users/jmoon/Downloads/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data (1).xlsx",
             sheet="Mr. Trash Wheel",
             range = "A2:N586") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered=(weight_tons*(500/30))) %>%
  mutate(source="mr") %>% 
  mutate(year=as.numeric(year))

#584 observations of 15 variables
```

Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Professor Trash Wheel

``` r
prof_trashwheel<-
  read_excel("C:/Users/jmoon/Downloads/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data (1).xlsx",
             sheet="Professor Trash Wheel",
             range = "A2:M108") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered=(weight_tons*(500/30)))%>% 
  mutate(source="prof")

#106 observations of 14 variables

#216.26 tons total of trash collected
```

Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Gwynnda,

``` r
g_trashwheel<-
  read_excel("C:/Users/jmoon/Downloads/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data (1).xlsx",
             sheet="Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
             range = "A2:L157") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered=(weight_tons*(500/30)))%>% 
  mutate(source="gwynnda")

#155 observations of 13 variables

filter(g_trashwheel,year==2021, month=="July")
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 13
    ##   dumpster month  year date                weight_tons volume_cubic_yards
    ##      <dbl> <chr> <dbl> <dttm>                    <dbl>              <dbl>
    ## 1        1 July   2021 2021-07-03 00:00:00        0.93                 15
    ## 2        2 July   2021 2021-07-07 00:00:00        2.26                 15
    ## 3        3 July   2021 2021-07-07 00:00:00        1.62                 15
    ## 4        4 July   2021 2021-07-16 00:00:00        1.76                 15
    ## 5        5 July   2021 2021-07-30 00:00:00        1.53                 15
    ## # ℹ 7 more variables: plastic_bottles <dbl>, polystyrene <dbl>,
    ## #   cigarette_butts <dbl>, plastic_bags <dbl>, wrappers <dbl>,
    ## #   homes_powered <dbl>, source <chr>

``` r
#16,3000 cigarette butts from July 2021
```

combine these with the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy
dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_tidy = 
  bind_rows(mr_trashwheel, prof_trashwheel, g_trashwheel) %>% 
  relocate(source) %>% 
  separate(date, into=c("year1", "month1", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  select(-year1,-month1) %>% 
  relocate(day, .before=year)

#used "source" variable to keep track of which data was from which dataset

#I chose to separate out the day because the date value felt redundant

#there are 845 observations with 15 variables
```

*Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline
R.*

There were many more observations from mr_trashwheel than from
prof_trashwheel or gwynnda_trashwheel, while prof_trashwheel and
gwynnda_trashwheel were similar. In this data, Mr. Trash Wheel ran from
2014-2023, Professor Trash Wheel ran from 2017-2023, and Gwynnda Trash
Wheel ran from 2021-2023. Gwynnda Trashwheel found no glass bottles or
sports balls and Professor Trash Wheel found no sports balls. Homes
powered ranged from around 10 to around 94.

## Question 3

Import, clean, and tidy the dataset of baseline demographics.

- Discuss important steps in the import process and relevant features of
  the dataset.

``` r
baseline<-
  read.csv("C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv",
           skip = 1) %>% 
#used skip to ensure the first row is headings 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
#cleaning names
  mutate(sex=recode(sex, "1"="male", "0"="female")) %>% 
  mutate(apoe4=recode(apoe4, "1"="carrier", "0"="non-carrier")) %>% 
  filter(age_at_onset !=".")
#removed missing age_at_onset values 


print(class(baseline$sex))
```

    ## [1] "character"

``` r
print(class(baseline$apoe4))
```

    ## [1] "character"

``` r
#sex and APOE4 carrier status were both encoded as integers-->changed to characters
```

*How many participants were recruited, and of these how many develop
MCI?*

483 participants were recruited and 97 developed MCI

``` r
print(class(baseline$age_at_onset))

vector_age<-as.numeric(baseline$age_at_onset)
print(mean(vector_age))

filter(baseline, sex=="female")
#46 observations

filter(baseline, sex=="female",apoe4=="carrier")
#30 observations

30/46
```

*What is the average baseline age?*

The average baseline age is 70.26289.

*What proportion of women in the study are APOE4 carriers?)*

0.6521739

65.22% of women in the study are APOE4 carriers–of those that developed
MCI

Import, clean, and tidy the dataset of longitudinally observed biomarker
values;

*comment on the steps on the import process and the features of the
dataset.*

``` r
biomarkers<-read.csv("C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv",
                     skip=1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(id=study_id)
#This dataset is formatted wide, but I do not wish to change it to longer as that would affect the join options with the baseline dataset.
```

*Check whether some participants appear in only the baseline or amyloid
datasets, and comment on your findings.*

Using join and anti_join to do this

``` r
base_bio = 
  left_join(baseline, biomarkers, by = "id")
#left_joining to baseline because there are fewer participants in the baseline dataset.
#those who are in the biomarkers dataset but are not in the baseline dataset will not be joined
```

``` r
anti_joined_data<-anti_join(baseline, biomarkers, by="id")
```

After filtering out those participants that never develop MCI, there are
many participants that only appear in the biomarkers dataset. However,
there are three other participants that only appear in the baseline
dataset.

``` r
baseline_filtered<-filter(baseline, id !="14", id !="49", id !="268")

#filtering out the participant id's of those in the baseline dataset but not the biomarkers dataset
```

Combine the demographic and biomarker datasets so that only participants
who appear in both datasets are retained

``` r
base_bio_final = 
  left_join(baseline_filtered, biomarkers, by = "id")
```

*briefly describe the resulting dataset;*

There are 94 observations of 11 variables in this dataset. The “current
ages” of participants range from 58.1 years to 71.6 years. The youngest
age at onset was 61.2 and the oldest age at onset was 77.2 years. There
are 60 carriers and 34 non-carriers and there are 44 females and 50
males.

``` r
count(base_bio_final, sex)
```

    ##      sex  n
    ## 1 female 44
    ## 2   male 50

``` r
count(base_bio_final, apoe4)
```

    ##         apoe4  n
    ## 1     carrier 60
    ## 2 non-carrier 34

export the result as a CSV to your data directory.

``` r
write.csv(base_bio_final, "C:/Users/jmoon/OneDrive/Desktop/data_mci/base_bio.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```
